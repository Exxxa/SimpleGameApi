## Introduction
This repository hosts the group project for the INF4051 course. Each student team is required to clone this repository, create a branch with their team name, and update the README file with details about their team members.

## Cloning the Repository
To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:
```
git clone https://gitlab.esiea.fr/inf4051-students-2024/group-project.git
```

## Creating a Branch
Once you have cloned the repository, navigate to the project directory and create a branch using your team name:
```
cd group-project
git checkout -b [team-name-branch]
```
Replace `[team-name-branch]` with your team's name, using lowercase letters and hyphens for spaces.

## Updating the README File
After creating your team's branch, update the README file by adding a section for your team members.

### Steps:
1. Open the `README.md` file in a text editor.
2. Add a section titled `Team Members`.
3. Under this section, list the surname and name of each team member.

## Committing and Pushing Changes
After updating the README file, commit and push your changes to the repository:

```
git add README.md
git commit -m "Add team members"
git push origin [team-name-branch]
```
Replace `[team-name-branch]` with the name of your branch.

## Final Steps
Once you have pushed your changes, create a merge request on GitLab to merge your team's branch into the main branch. Ensure your merge request is titled with your team name for easy identification.
